# How to get API working
Go to `AccountsAPI\` directory and create a file called `.env`. In said file put the following info:

```env
USERNAME=username_here
PASSWORD=password_here
```

## How to get username and password
The username and password are both required for playtesters and developers alike if they want to login.
Contact @Game Glide on discord to get the credencials.

- **Note**: This won't be required once the API is hosted.
